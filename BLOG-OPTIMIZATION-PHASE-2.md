4. **Strategic Placement:** Opening (homepage), mid-article (cross-links), closing (CTA)
5. **User Experience First:** If link doesn't help reader, don't add it
6. **Hub-and-Spoke Model:** Every article links back to homepage (hub) and 2-3 related articles (spokes)

**Solution:** Added `mb-6` margin bottom to breadcrumb container, reduced SinglePost section top padding from `py-8` to `pt-0`, increased metadata margin bottom from `mb-2` to `mb-4`

**Files Modified:**
- `src/pages/[...blog]/index.astro` - Added margin bottom to breadcrumb wrapper

**Result:** Clean visual separation between breadcrumbs and article header, improved readability, better mobile experience
