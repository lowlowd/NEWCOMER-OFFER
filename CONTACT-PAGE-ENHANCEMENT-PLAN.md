- ⭐⭐⭐ **URGENT:** "KOHO promotion" (70/mo) - Currently only 2 mentions across entire site
- ⭐⭐⭐ **URGENT:** "koho refer a friend" (20/mo) - Currently ZERO mentions across entire site
- ⭐⭐ **HIGH PRIORITY:** "KOHO referral bonus" (90/mo) - Only 3-4 mentions total
- ⭐⭐ **HIGH PRIORITY:** "KOHO sign up bonus" (90/mo) - Only 8 mentions total

**Expected Impact:**
- +800-850 words (633% content increase)
- +12-14 strategic internal links
- All 10 target keywords naturally integrated (60+ keyword mentions)
- Estimated traffic gain: +30-50 visits/month from contact page alone
- Foundation for ranking underutilized keywords ("promotion", "refer a friend")

---

## 🎯 CURRENT STATE ANALYSIS

**Current Contact Page:**
- ✅ Clear hero section with CTA
- ✅ FAQ link card
- ✅ Official KOHO support links
- ⚠️ **THIN CONTENT** - Only ~150 words
- ⚠️ No keyword optimization
