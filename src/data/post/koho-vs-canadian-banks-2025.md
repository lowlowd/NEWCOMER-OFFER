Choosing where to put your money is a big deal, and the options in 2025 go far beyond the traditional Big Five banks you see on every corner. This comparison shows how KOHO stacks up against big banks like RBC and TD, and online players such as EQ Bank and Tangerine.

## The Big Five: Convenience at a Cost

Canada's major banks—RBC, TD, Scotiabank, BMO, and CIBC—offer full-service banking with branches and ATMs nationwide, plus everything from chequing to mortgages and investments. The tradeoff is often higher monthly fees and complex fee structures for everyday banking.

## Online-Only Banks: Better Rates, Fewer Products

Digital banks like EQ Bank and Tangerine reduce overhead and pass on savings via no-fee accounts and higher deposit rates, but they typically offer fewer in-house products and no branch support for complex issues.

## Where KOHO Fits

KOHO isn't a bank—it's a fintech with a reloadable prepaid Mastercard and a powerful money app focused on day-to-day spending, real-time tracking, and effortless saving. It's built to remove common pain points of everyday banking.

### No Monthly Fees or NSF Surprises

KOHO core accounts have no monthly fees, no e‑Transfer fees, and no interest/overdraft charges because you can only spend what you load, eliminating NSF shocks that can run $45+ at traditional banks.
